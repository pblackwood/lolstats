# LOL Stats

Based originally on the AngularJS [Phone Catalog Tutorial] (https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat).

## Overview

This application allows LOL teams to track their stats, whether or not they are a ranked team.

The GUI uses AngularJS. The server is node.js and persists data to mongodb. Game data comes 
from the [Riot Games API] (https://developer.riotgames.com).

## Motivation

My son, who plays League every day, complains that it is impossible to get stats on a team,
instead of an individual player.

My motivation is to learn the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node).
