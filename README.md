# LOL Stats - Based originally on AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application

## Overview

This application allows LOL teams to track their stats, whether or not they are a ranked team.
The app pulls data from Riot Games API.

The GUI uses AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer
exists. Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215082038/http://www.android.com/devices/).

## Motivation

My son, who plays League every day, complains that it is impossible to get stats on a team,
instead of an individual player.

My motivation is to learn Angular, node.js, and mongo db.
